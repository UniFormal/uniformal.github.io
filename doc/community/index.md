## How to get help

**Static sources of help:**

- [*this* very documentation website](https://uniformal.github.io/)
- [the wiki](https://github.com/UniFormal/uniformal.github.io/wiki) containing fixes for common error messages, some FAQs, and miscellaneous helpful blobs of information that are not quite relevant or polished enough for the above documentation website.

**Interactive sources of help:** (i.e. with humans answering)

- The [MMT channel on KWARC' MatterMost instance](https://mattermost.kwarc.info/kwarc/channels/mmt). All questions related to MMT are welcome &mdash; from end user to API developer, from broad to very specific. With your GitHub account, you can coin with three clicks: first click on *GitLab* redirecting you to our internal GitLab instance <https://gl.kwarc.info>, there click on *GitHub*, and finally confirm this action in the appearing dialog.

- [StackOverflow with mmt tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mmt) (great for pin-pointed questions of general interest, e.g. recurring beginner questions)

     In case you don't get an answer there, feel free to remind us by sending a link to the StackOverflow question on the MMT MatterMost channel above.

- Mailing lists (great for longer "big picture" questions)

  -  [mmt-users@kwarc.info](http://lists.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/mailman/listinfo/mmt-users)
  
     Communication between developers and users as well as among users. Announcements about MMT (e.g., new releases) as well as any general requests or inquiries.

  - [mmt-dev@kwarc.info](http://lists.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/mailman/listinfo/mmt-dev)
