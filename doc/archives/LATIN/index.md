title: "The LATIN Project: Logic Atlas and Integrator"
---

LATIN aims at developing methods, techniques, and tools for interfacing logics and proof
systems. Logics allow making the mathematical knowledge at the core of science,
engineering, and economics accessible to computational systems like (semi-)automated
theorem provers, model checkers, computer algebra systems, constraint solvers, or concept
classifiers. Unfortunately, these systems have differing foundational assumptions and
input languages, which makes them non-interoperable and difficult to compare and evaluate
in practice.

The LATIN project focuses on developing a foundationally unconstrained framework for
knowledge representation that allows to represent the meta-theoretic foundations of the
mathematical knowledge in the same format and to interlink the foundations at the
meta-logical level. This approach of *logics as theories* leads to interoperability
of both system behavior and represented knowledge.

To evaluate the developed framework and provide a service to the community, the project
will build an atlas of logics used in automated reasoning, mathematics, and software
engineering concentrating on paradigmatic logics from first-order logic (TPTP, CASL, and
Mizar), higher-order logics (PVS, Isabelle/HOL, HasCASL), and logical frameworks (LF and
Isabelle). For all of these we will build logic representations in our framework and
(where possible) structure and relate them using logic morphisms.

Finally we will make the logic atlas sustainable and future-proof by developing a
community portal, a tool suite, and a workflow that allow outside users to add their
logics to the Logic Atlas by representing them in the LATIN framework and provide
interoperability-inducing logic morphisms.

## Orignal Project

The original [LATIN project](latin1) ran from 2009-2012.

## Current Incarnation

The MMT Archive [LATIN2](latin2) is a from-scratch revision of the original logic atlas.
