title: Running MMT without a GUI
---

New users usually use MMT via one of the [IDEs](../applications/ides.html), which use MMT as a backend.

Alternatively, advanced users can run MMT directly.
This is described below.

After [setting up](./) MMT, the jars in the `deploy` folder can be run normally via Java.
The canonical way to do that is to run
```
java -jar MMT/deploy/mmt.jar
```

For convenience, the folder `MMT/deploy` contains shell scripts for Windows and Unix that are directly executable.

However, to casually sample MMT, you should not execute MMT directly at all.
Instead, you should setup [jedit](jedit) and play with MMT example files.

### Run Modes

MMT can be used in 3 different modes

* *batch:* MMT executes its command-line arguments (if any).
    This is the initial mode. When the command-line arguments have been executing, MMT transitions into interactive or server mode.
* *interactive:* MMT displays a shell and responds to commands interactively.
    The end-of-input character transitions into server mode; the command exit terminates MMT completely.
* *server:* MMT waits for auxiliary threads (if any) to terminate and then terminates. This is typically run as a background thread.
    Auxiliary threads may include in particular the MMT [web server](../applications/server).

Depending on the command line arguments, MMT chooses whether it switches to interactive or server mode.
In particular, without any arguments, it switches to interactive mode.

### Startup Code

Whenever MMT is run, it looks for a startup script in the location `deploy/startup.msl`.
MMT also tries to load a configuration from `deploy/mmtrc` or from your OS-specific home directory.
The latter is created during setup.

This is particularly useful for registering extensions and archives that depend on machine-specific external paths.
An example startup is provided in the file `deploy/startup.msl.example`.

### Customizing MMT

Because MMT is [language and application-independent](../philosophy/independence), running MMT by itself does not do anything - MMT must be customized by defining a language and building an application on top of the MMT tool.
The MMT system suite includes [various language definitions](../archives/oaf) and [applications](../applications) to use.
See the respective pages for instructions on loading individual languages and running individual applications.

### Other Ways to Run MMT during Development

Developers may also want to run MMT in different ways.

#### Running from Small Jar Files

The `deploy` folder contains `mmt.jar`, which is simply the union of the individual jars in the `main` folder.
When developing specific parts of MMT, it is usually sufficient to rebuild only the individual jar that was changed.

The `deploy` folder contains shell scripts that automate running from these smaller jars:

* `mmt` (for Unix) and `mmt.bat` (for Windows): executes MMT commands and/or opens an [MMT shell](../applications/shell), `mmt -help` displays the available options
* `run-file.bat`: a convenience script for Windows that can be associated with MMT shell scripts.

Users may wish to add the deploy folder to the PATH enviroment variable.

#### Running from Classes

When working in an IDE, you usually want to run MMT directly from classes rather than building a jar file.

For that, use the main class `info.kwarc.mmt.api.frontend.Run` in the project `mmt-api`.

If you need to use additional projects, you can build those into classes as well or use the individual jars mentioned above.
