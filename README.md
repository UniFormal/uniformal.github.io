# UniFormal Documentation: <https://uniformal.github.io/>

This repository contains the homepage and documentation of the [MMT system](https://kwarc.info/systems/mmt/).

It is built and served by GitHub pages (i.e. based on Jekyll) <https://uniformal.github.io/>. Moreover, independently, some linting is performed via GitHub actions, which checks for dead links among other things.

Also, the [wiki accompanying this repo](https://github.com/UniFormal/uniformal.github.io/wiki) contains some articles not yet worked into the official deployed site. In particular, caused and fixes for common error messages are detailed there.

## Issues

Please report any issues with the documentation in the [main MMT issue tracker](https://github.com/UniFormal/MMT/issues/new) with the "documentation" label.
