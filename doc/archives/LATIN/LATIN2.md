title: "LATIN2: Modular Logic Formalizations"
---

## Overview

The LATIN2 library of modular logic formalizations supersedes the [original LATIN project](latin1), which ran from 2009-2012.

LATIN2 is a from-scratch revision of the original LATIN logic formalizations.
It is built using and co-evolves with the [MMT](https://uniformal.github.io) system. (This is in contrast to LATIN1, which was written in modular Twelf.)

The repository holding the LATIN2 library is https://gl.mathhub.info/MMT/LATIN2
