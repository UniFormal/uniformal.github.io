The following resources are useful for researchers to get a more detailed understanding:

* This [10 page overview](articles/mmt.pdf) describes the design and applications of MMT for casually interested researchers.
* This 2020 [video](https://vimeo.com/421123419) was taken of my talk on MMT in Andrej Bauer's seminar on [Every Proof Assistant](http://math.andrej.com/2020/05/15/mmt-a-foundation-independent-logical-system/).
* This set of [slides](articles/mmt-slides.pdf) is the union of various overview talks on MMT.
* The (relatively old) text [MMT vs. X](articles/mmt-vs-X.pdf) describes MMT in terms of how it differs from other systems.
* The original [journal article](https://kwarc.info/people/frabe/Research/RK_mmt_10.pdf) on the MMT language describes the motivation and approach in depth. (Some details on the MMT language may be outdated by now.)
* This [journal article](https://kwarc.info/people/frabe/Research/KR_qed_14.pdf) gives an overview of how MMT contributes to the QED question of integrating formal systems.
